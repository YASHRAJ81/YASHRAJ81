# Introduction



# Creating or editing your profile README

Your profile README lets you share information about yourself with the community on GitHub.com. The README is displayed at the top of your profile page.

If you don't already have a profile README, you can add one.

- Create a repository with the same name as your GitHub username, initializing the repository with a README.md file. For more information, see "Managing your profile README."
- Edit the README.md file and delete the template text (beginning ### Hi there) that is automatically added when you create the file.
- If you already have a profile README, you can edit it from your profile page.
